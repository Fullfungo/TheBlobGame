# TheBlobGame

## How to use

You can put your _**Player Strategy**_ code into `player.hpp` or create a `player.cpp` file if you prefere to do so.

The **Player** recieves the number of heads and tails that the blob fliped so far, as well as the number of flips you have left.

The **Player** must decide if they want to call the current blob _Fair_, a _Cheater_, or state if the **Player** is _Unsure_ to flip again.
