# TheBlobGame

## How to use

You can put your _**Player Strategy**_ code into `player.hpp` or create a `player.cpp` file if you prefer to do so.

The **Player** receives the number of heads and tails that the current blob has flipped so far, as well as the number of flips you have left.

The **Player** must decide if they want to call the current blob _Fair_, _Biased_ (a Cheater), or state if the **Player** is _Unsure_ in order to flip again.
